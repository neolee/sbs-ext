                <h3>Scenario 1: The Critical Opening Lead</h3>
                <p>
                    This deal from the 2025 World Championship illustrates a classic defensive problem. 
                    South has reached a contract of 4 Hearts after a competitive auction. 
                    West, holding a balanced hand with scattered values, must find the killer opening lead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the auction, North showed a strong spade suit before supporting hearts. 
                    This strongly suggests that South is short in spades. A spade lead, therefore, 
                    seems attractive but might be ruffed immediately, or worse, set up a trick for declarer 
                    if they hold the King or Queen guarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Trump Lead Option:</strong> A trump lead is often right when the opponents 
                    are cross-ruffing, but here, the dummy (North) has shown strength. Leading a trump 
                    might pick up partner's potential Queen or Jack, giving declarer a free finesse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Passive Defense:</strong> West might consider a club lead. 
                    Holding the King-Ten, leading a low club is standard. However, if declarer holds 
                    the Ace-Queen, this lead gives away a trick instantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Scroll down to see the widget stick...)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, West chose the <strong>Spade 2</strong>. Let's analyze why this works. 
                    Declarer plays low from dummy, East wins with the Ace and returns a spade. 
                    South ruffs, but now the defensive communication is established.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later in the play, when West gets in with the King of Diamonds, they can lead 
                    another spade. This forces declarer to ruff again, shortening their trump holding 
                    to a dangerous level. This "forcing defense" is effective because West has 
                    four trumps to the King-Jack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If West had led a trump originally, declarer would have drawn trumps immediately, 
                    losing only one trump trick and two diamond tricks. The spade lead was the only 
                    way to generate four defensive tricks.

                <h3>Scenario 2: Endplay Technique</h3>
                <p>
                    In this second example, we look at a declarer play problem. 
                    South is in 6NT. The lead is the Jack of Hearts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    South has 11 top tricks: 3 Spades, 3 Hearts, 4 Diamonds, and 1 Club. 
                    The 12th trick must come from Clubs or a squeeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simple line is to take the Club finesse. If West holds the King, 
                    the slam is made. This is a 50% chance. Can we do better?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's look at the distribution. West has shown up with long hearts. 
                    If West also holds the King of Clubs, he might be squeezed. 
                    But there is a safer line: The Endplay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    South wins the Heart lead, draws rounds of Spades and Diamonds, 
                    stripping West of safe exit cards. Finally, South exits with a Heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    West wins but is now endplayed. He must lead a Club (giving South a free finesse) 
                    or lead a Heart/Spade/Diamond (giving a ruff-and-discard, though in NT it just means 
                    leading into a tenace).
